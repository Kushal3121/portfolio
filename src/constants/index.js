People counting plays a vital role in preventing risks during large gatherings. Techniques like crowd anomaly detection, behavior analysis, and human action identification aid in monitoring crowd density. This project leverages image and video processing to estimate the number of individuals, benefiting public event organizers, security systems, and campus management.',
